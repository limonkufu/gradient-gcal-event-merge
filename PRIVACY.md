# Privacy Policy

**Gradient Merge for Google Calendar**

*Last updated: January 2025*

## Overview

Gradient Merge for Google Calendar ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what information the Extension collects, how it is used, and what choices you have.

**In short: We do not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

## Data Collection

### What We DO NOT Collect

The Extension does NOT collect:
- Calendar events, titles, descriptions, or attendees
- Personal information or account details
- Browsing history or activity
- Analytics or usage data
- Any data for advertising purposes

### What We Store Locally

The Extension stores only your preferences using your browser's built-in storage API:
- Extension enabled/disabled state
- Weekend highlighting preference
- Gradient opacity setting
- Theme preference (light/dark/system)
- Weekend highlight colors

This data is stored locally in your browser and may sync across your devices through your browser's built-in sync feature (e.g., Chrome Sync), which is controlled by your browser settings.

## Data Transmission

**The Extension does not transmit any data to external servers.**

- No data is sent to us or any third parties
- No analytics or tracking services are used
- No remote code is loaded or executed
- All processing happens locally in your browser

## Permissions

The Extension requests minimal permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `storage` | Save your preferences locally |
| Access to Google Calendar pages | Modify visual appearance of overlapping events |

The Extension only operates on Google Calendar (`calendar.google.com` and `www.google.com/calendar`). It cannot access any other websites.

## How the Extension Works

The Extension modifies only the visual styling of Google Calendar in your browser. It:
- Detects visually overlapping calendar events on the page
- Applies gradient backgrounds to indicate multiple simultaneous events
- Optionally highlights weekends with customizable colors

**Important:** The Extension reads the visual layout of calendar elements to apply styling. It does NOT access, read, or process the content of your calendar events (titles, descriptions, times, attendees, etc.).

## Third Parties

The Extension does not:
- Share data with third parties
- Include third-party analytics
- Use advertising networks
- Integrate with external services

## Your Choices

You can:
- Disable the Extension at any time through browser settings or the Extension popup
- Clear stored preferences by removing and reinstalling the Extension
- Control browser sync settings to prevent preferences from syncing across devices

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
